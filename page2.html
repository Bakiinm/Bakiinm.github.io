    <p>

My love,<br><br>

If this song is playing while you’re reading this,<br>
I want you to slow down.<br>
Take your time.<br>
Let every word sink in the way every note does.<br><br>

There are some people in this world you meet and forget.<br>
And then there are people who feel like home the moment they arrive.<br>
You were never just someone who came into my life —<br>
you became a part of it, quietly, deeply, permanently.<br><br>

They say birds of a feather flock together.<br>
I never fully understood that until you.<br>
Until I realized how natural it felt to choose you every single day.<br>
How my heart learned your rhythm without trying.<br>
How being with you felt less like effort and more like instinct.<br><br>

Being with you doesn’t feel loud.<br>
It feels safe.<br>
It feels like breathing without thinking about it.<br>
Like silence that isn’t empty,<br>
like holding hands without needing words.<br><br>

I don’t love you because everything is perfect.<br>
I love you because even when things are messy,<br>
even when we’re tired, scared, or unsure,<br>
my heart still reaches for yours first.<br>
Every time.<br><br>

There are parts of me you’ve seen that no one else has.<br>
The quiet fears.<br>
The doubts I don’t say out loud.<br>
The moments when I don’t feel strong.<br>
And instead of turning away, you stayed.<br>
You stayed when it would’ve been easier not to.<br><br>

And now, life is asking us to be brave in a different way.<br>
To love each other through distance.<br>
Through silence that lasts longer than we want.<br>
Through days where missing you feels heavier than anything else.<br><br>

February 11 keeps getting closer.<br>
And I won’t lie — it scares me.<br>
Not because I don’t trust you.<br>
Not because I don’t believe in us.<br>
But because you’ve become such a constant in my life<br>
that the thought of not having you here feels unreal.<br><br>

There will be mornings when I reach for my phone first thing,<br>
hoping to see your name.<br>
Nights when I replay memories just to feel close to you again.<br>
Moments when I wish I could tell you something small<br>
and realize how far away you are.<br><br>

But even then…<br>
even in the missing,<br>
even in the waiting,<br>
my heart will still recognize yours.<br><br>

Because love like this doesn’t disappear with distance.<br>
It doesn’t weaken with time.<br>
It doesn’t fade just because oceans exist between us.<br>
If anything, it proves how real it is.<br><br>

I will love you in the quiet moments.<br>
I will love you in the waiting.<br>
I will love you when the days are long<br>
and when the nights feel lonely.<br>
I will love you when you’re tired, busy, and far away.<br><br>

Because loving you isn’t something I do when it’s convenient.<br>
It’s something my heart does naturally.<br><br>

No matter where you are,<br>
no matter how far life takes you,<br>
no matter how much time passes —<br>
my heart will always know where it belongs.<br><br>

We are made of the same kind of love.<br>
The same kind of hope.<br>
The same kind of choosing.<br><br>

Birds of a feather, my love.<br>
Always finding their way back to each other.<br><br>

I love you.<br>
Still.<br>
Always.
