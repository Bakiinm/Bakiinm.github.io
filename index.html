    <p>
        <strong>My love,</strong><br><br>

        If you’re reading this while the song is playing,  
        I want you to know something first.<br><br>

        This isn’t just a message.<br>
        This is me standing in front of you,  
        with nothing to hide,  
        hoping you feel what I feel.<br><br>

        Loving you feels like building a home piece by piece.<br><br>

        Not something rushed.<br>
        Not something perfect.<br><br>

        But something made carefully, patiently, with intention.<br><br>

        Every smile we shared was a brick.<br>
        Every late-night conversation was another wall.<br>
        Every time we chose to stay,  
        even when it was hard,  
        we built the foundation a little stronger.<br><br>

        There were moments I didn’t know if I was building right.<br>
        Moments I was scared I’d place the wrong piece  
        and everything would fall apart.<br><br>

        But even then, you stayed.<br>
        You held my hands while I learned.<br>
        You believed in what we were building,  
        even when I doubted myself.<br><br>

        And now… life is asking us to step away  
        from what we built, just for a while.<br><br>

        February 11 feels closer every time I breathe.<br>
        The idea of waking up without you next to me  
        hurts in ways I don’t know how to explain.<br><br>

        Not because I don’t trust us —<br>
        but because loving you has become my everyday comfort.<br><br>

        You’re leaving to chase a dream you worked so hard for.<br>
        And I am so incredibly proud of you.<br><br>

        But loving you also means learning how to miss you quietly,<br>
        how to hold back tears in empty rooms,<br>
        how to count days not by calendars,  
        but by how much my heart longs for you.<br><br>

        There will be nights when the world feels too quiet.<br>
        When I replay your voice just to feel close to you.<br>
        When I look at the sky  
        and wonder if you’re looking at the same stars  
        from the middle of the ocean.<br><br>

        But listen to me, love.<br><br>

        Even when distance tries to pull us apart,<br>
        I will keep building.<br>
        I will keep every memory safe.<br>
        I will protect what we started,  
        brick by brick, day by day.<br><br>

        Because what we built isn’t fragile.<br>
        It isn’t temporary.<br>
        It isn’t something that disappears  
        just because oceans exist between us.<br><br>

        If everything else in the world fell apart tomorrow,<br>
        I would still choose to build my life around you.<br><br>

        Again.<br>
        And again.<br>
        And again.<br><br>

        So go.<br>
        Chase your dreams.<br>
        Carry my love with you wherever the waves take you.<br><br>

        And when the days feel long, remember this —<br>
        there is someone back home, patiently waiting,<br>
        protecting what we built,<br>
        believing in the day you come back…<br><br>

        so we can continue building, together.<br><br>

        <strong>I love you.</strong><br>
        <strong>Always.</strong>
